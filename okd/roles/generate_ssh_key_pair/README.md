# generate_ssh_key_pair

Generates an ssh key pair

By default an SSH key will be generated by the `deploy_cluster.yml` playbook.
This can be disabled by adding `generate_ssh_keys = False` to the inventory.It is possible to configure the task generating the SSH key (see the docs for `community.crypto.openssh_keypair`) by setting `openssh_keypair_args` with a dictionary.
