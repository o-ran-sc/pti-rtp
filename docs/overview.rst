INF Overview
************

This project is for reference implementations of O-Cloud infrastructure which is compliant with `O-RAN Cloud Platform Reference Designs`_ in `O-RAN ALLIANCE Specifications`_.

In O-RAN architecture, the near-RT RIC, O-DU and O-CU could have different deployment scenarios. They could be container based or VM based, and the performance sensitive parts
of the 5G stack require real time platform, especially for O-DU, the L1 and L2 are requiring the real time feature, all these will be supported by the O-Clouds in INF project.

`StarlingX`_ is an opensrouce cloud-native infrastructure project with fully integrated cloud software stack that provides a fully featured open source distributed cloud
(See `StarlingX Distributed Cloud`_ for details). In different deployment scenarios in the O-RAN architecture, `StarlingX`_ O-Cloud can be deployed as a Regional Cloud Platform
to support Near-RT RIC and/or O-CU, or as Edge Cloud Platform to support O-DU and/or O-CU.
